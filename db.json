      "describtion": "The Paxley family is one of the most powerful, proud and prestigious magic families in the Land of Dawn, and each of it's member is raised to become a mage of the finest order. In their eyes, the path of the magician is the most sacred and noble vocation there is, and all those who brandish a sword in battle are merely considered as insubstantial weaklings and dim-witted fools. Gusion, however, was determined to break the mold. The patriarch's fourth son, Gusion, exhibited a high affinity towards light elements at a very early age, but rather than spend his days with his nose buried in a book studying spells.",

When the magical tribes of the Elves were passing by, Lancelot, who had just awoken from a drunken stupor and a good old fashioned bar brawl, arrogantly attacked them. After winning a few battles, he dropped his guard and pursued the remaining elves in arrogance, but soon the magical tribes regrouped and defeated him within the mountains.",

He had always tried hard, to conceal his true identity and blend in with human society.\n\n",
